## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. It should have a table of content (TOC form) or in a tab form. The Rmd files of Tab and Toc form are available on the class webpage. 

**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use Rmd samples of the class slides that are available on the class webpage. 
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can follow these below instructions. 
    
    - https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figure-size.html
    
    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient.

-------

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 

```{r}
library(haven)
df <- read_sas('C:/Users/student/OneDrive - Bryant University/Documents/R/Math421/hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
```

    
3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=18`)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
df <- df %>% filter(yod==18)
```

    
4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
                      "yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day"
```
 
 
```{r}
df <- df %>% select(yod,payfix, pay_ub92, age, sex, raceethn, provider, moa, yoa, mod, admtype, asource, preopday, los, service, icu, ccu, dispub92, payer, drg, trandb, randbg, randbs, orr, anes, seq, lab, dtest, ther,blood,phar,other,patcon,bwght,total,tot,ecodub92,b_wt,pt_state,diag_adm,ancilar, campus,er_fee,er_chrg,er_mode,obs_chrg,obs_hour,psycchrg,nicu_day)

```


*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(df, 'midterm_csv')
```

5. What are variables that have missing values?

```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
```

 
6. Remove all variables with missing values. 

```{r}
df <- df %>% select(-payfix, -preopday, -obs_hour, -nicu_day)
```

 
7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?

```{r}
#Month of Admission - moa
#Month of Discharge - mod
```


8. Which month admitted the most number of patients? Which month admitted the most number of male patients?

```{r}
df %>% 
  count(moa) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
#October admitted the most patients
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='1') %>% 
  count(moa) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
#October admitted most male patients
```


9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='2', age>='13'& age<='19') %>% 
  count(moa) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
#March has most teenage female patients
```


10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October? 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='2', moa=='10') %>% 
  count(provider) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
#provider 7205 has the most female patients in October
```


11. Are female patients older than male patients, on average? 

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(average_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_age)
#Male patients are older on average
```


12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(moa) %>% 
  summarise(average_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_age)
#January has the oldest patients on average
```

13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(provider) %>% 
  summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_tot)
#Provider 7215 has the highest total charge
```

14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(provider) %>% 
  filter(sex=='1', age>='13'& age<='19') %>% 
  summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(average_tot)
#Provider 7206 has the least charge for teenage males on average
```


15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season.  Which season has the longest length of stays on average?

```{r}
df$season <- case_when(df$moa>=3 & df$moa < 6 ~ 'Spring', df$moa >= 6 & df$moa <9 ~'Summer', df$moa>= 9 & df$moa <12~  'Fall', TRUE ~ 'Winter')

df %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarise(average_los = mean(los)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_los)
#Summer has the longest length of stays on average
```


16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='1', age=='20', season=='Fall', los=='1') %>% 
  summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(average_tot)
#16511
```


17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points. 

This section was focused on importing a dataset and lightly manipulating it in order to analyze it. I used a number of functions to count, arrange, summarize, and filter. Before analyzing the data, however, I had to filter only patients in 2018, and remove all variables with missing values. Some of my takeaways from this section are October had the most patients out of any month, summer had the longest length of stay on average, and January has the oldest patients on average. I also found it interesting that male patients are older on average, event though this is intuitively pleasing.

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)

df$sex <- case_when(
    df$sex==1 ~ 'Male',
    df$sex==2 ~ 'Female',
    TRUE ~ 'Unknown'
  )

df$raceethn <- case_when(
    df$raceethn==1 ~ 'White',

  labs(x='Age',
       y='Payer',
       title='Age Distributions Based on Payer',
       caption='Box plot summarizing distribution  
       for patient age for each payer.')

```

```{r}

       caption = 'Blacks patients have a significantly higher average age when compared to other races.')
```

```{r}

       y='Patients',
       title='Count of Patient per Season',
       caption='Bar chart shows that Spring had
       the most patients admitted of any season.')

```

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = los, y = tot, color = dispub92))+
  labs(x='Length of Stay',
       y='Total Charge',
       title='Relationship Between Length of Stay Total Charge Rates by Sex',
       caption='Positive relationship 
       between length of stay and total charge.')
```

  labs(x='Month',
       y='Proportion',
       title='Admission Type Proportions per Month',
       caption='This chart shows a consistent pattern in admission type throughout the year')
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = moa, fill=sex))+
  labs(x='Month',
       y='Number of Patients',
       title='Number of Patients per Month',
       caption='This chart shows that January, May, and October have the most patients.')
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(admtype, sex) %>% 
  summarise(average_tot=mean(tot, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+ 
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=admtype, 
                       y=average_tot 
                       ), 
           position = 'dodge')+
  labs(x='Type of Admission', 
       y = 'Average Cost', 
        
       title = 'Average Cost by Type of Admission',

       title='Relationship Between Length of Stay Total Charge Rates by Payer',
       caption='All payers follow expected trend, but Workers Compensation and Self Pay are more abbreviated in their length of stay.')
```

2. Make an animation plot. 

```{r}
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

d1 <- df %>% group_by(moa, payer) %>% summarise(mean = mean(tot))
d2 <- d1 %>% group_by(moa) %>% mutate(rank=rank(-mean)) 
d3 <- d2 %>% filter(rank <= 10)
a1 <- d3 %>% ggplot(aes(x=rank, y=mean, group=payer, fill=payer, label=payer)) + geom_col()+
    geom_text(aes(y = mean, label = payer), hjust = 1.4)+ 
    coord_flip(clip = "off", expand = FALSE) +scale_x_reverse()+
    labs(title = 'Month {closest_state}', x='', y='Total Number of Patients', fill='payer')+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 22),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y  = element_blank()) + 
    transition_states(moa)+
    ease_aes("cubic-in-out")
animate(a1, nframes = 400)
```


3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

The above section contains a number of graphs and charts which cover a variety of topics relating to the Rhode Island Department of Health Discharge data. My goal was to explore which variables had an impact on other variables of importance. Some of my main findings include there is a steady increase in cost as length of stay increases, people who identify as white have the longest average length of stay, Spring had the most patients admitted out of any season, and admissions classified as "Emergency" had the highest average age of patients. The animated plot shows Medicaid is often the most frequent payment type. I found this section particularly interesting because of the freedom to make any meaningful plot.

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 

*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
  
-------

```{r}
library(dplyr)

df$target <- case_when(
  df$tot <= median(df$tot) ~ 'low',
  TRUE ~ 'high'
)

df$provider <- case_when(
  df$provider == 7201 ~ 'Newport',
  df$provider == 7202 ~ 'St. Joseph',
  df$provider == 7203 ~ 'Memorial',
  df$provider == 7204 ~ 'Miriam',
  df$provider == 7205 ~ 'Rhode Island Hospital',
  df$provider == 7206 ~ 'Roger Williams',
  df$provider == 7209 ~ 'South County',
  df$provider == 7210 ~ 'Kent County',
  df$provider == 7211 ~ 'Westerly',
  df$provider == 7212 ~ 'Rehab of RI',
  df$provider == 7213 ~ 'Landmark Medical Center',
  df$provider == 7214 ~ 'Women and Infants',
  df$provider == 7215 ~ 'Bradley',
  TRUE ~ 'Butler'
)


df$campus <- case_when(
  df$campus == 0 ~ 'Hospital Has Only One Premise',
  df$campus == 1 ~ 'St. Joseph Health Services of Rhode Island - Our Lady of Fatima Hospital',
  df$campus == 2 ~ 'St. Joseph Health Services of Rhode Island - St. Joseph Hospital for Specialty Care',
  df$campus == 3 ~ 'Rhode Island Hospital - Adult',
  TRUE ~ 'Rhode Island Hospital - Hasbro'
)

df2 <- df %>% select("target", "age", "sex", "raceethn", "provider", "moa", "mod", "admtype", "campus", "los")

```


1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90

```{r}
library(caret)

df2 <- df2 %>% 
  filter(raceethn!='',admtype!='') %>% 
  mutate(target=as.factor(target),
         age=age,
         sex=as.factor(sex),
         raceethn=as.factor(raceethn),
         provider=as.factor(provider),
         moa=moa,
         mod=mod,
         admtype=as.factor(admtype),
         campus=as.factor(campus),
         los=los)

set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df2$target, p = .1,
                                  list = FALSE)

df_train <- df2[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df2[-splitIndex,]
```


2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 

```{r}
library(rattle)
library(rpart)

tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                    control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
pred <- predict(tree_model, df_test, type = "class")
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = "low")
cm$overall[1]
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
```


3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 

```{r}
library(mlbench)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
                       splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
                       min.node.size = c(1:10))

Model2 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                method = "rpart1SE",
                maxdepth=5)
predSecond <- predict(Model2, df_test)
cmSecond <- confusionMatrix(data = predSecond, reference = df_test$target)
cmSecond$overall[1]

Model1 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                method = "glmnet",
                maxdepth=5)
predFirst <- predict(Model1, df_test)
cmFirst <- confusionMatrix(data = predFirst, reference = df_test$target)
cmFirst$overall[1]
```


4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 

```{r}
results <- resamples(list('glmnet' = Model1,
                          'rpart1SE' = Model2
                          ))
bwplot(results)
```


5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data. 

```{r}
predFinal <- predict(Model2, df_test)

cmFinal <- confusionMatrix(data = predFinal, reference = df_test$target, positive = "low")

cmFinal$overall[1]
```


6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 

```{r}
df <- read_sas('C:/Users/student/OneDrive - Bryant University/Documents/R/Math421/hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
df <- df %>% filter(yod==18)
df <- df %>% select(-payfix, -preopday, -obs_hour, -nicu_day)
df$sex <- case_when(
    df$sex==1 ~ 'Male',
    df$sex==2 ~ 'Female',
    TRUE ~ 'Unknown'
  )

df$raceethn <- case_when(
    df$raceethn==1 ~ 'White',
    df$raceethn==2 ~ 'Black',
    df$raceethn==3 ~ 'Asian',
    df$raceethn==4 ~ 'American Indian',
    df$raceethn==5 ~ 'Native Hawaiian',
    df$raceethn==6 ~ 'Other',
    df$raceethn==7 ~ 'Hispanic',
    TRUE ~ 'Unknown'
  )

df$admtype <- case_when(
    df$admtype==1 ~ 'Emergency',
    df$admtype==2 ~ 'Urgent',
    df$admtype==3 ~ 'Electric',
    df$admtype==4 ~ 'Newborn',
    df$admtype==5 ~ 'Court Committal',
    TRUE ~ 'Unknown'
  )
        
df$payer <- case_when(
    df$payer==0 ~ 'Medicare',
    df$payer==1 ~ 'Medicaid',
    df$payer==4 ~ 'Workers Comp',
    df$payer==5 ~ 'Blue Cross',
    df$payer==6 ~ 'Commercial Ins',
    df$payer==7 ~ 'Self Pay',
    TRUE ~ 'Unknown'
  )

df$dispub92 <- case_when(
    df$dispub92==01 ~ 'Self Care',
    df$dispub92==02 ~ 'Short Term Hosp',
    df$dispub92==03 ~ 'Nursing Fac',
    df$dispub92==04 ~ 'ICF',
    TRUE ~ 'Unknown'
   
)

df$target <- case_when(
  df$los <= median(df$los) ~ 'low',
  TRUE ~ 'high'
)

df$provider <- case_when(
  df$provider == 7201 ~ 'Newport',
  df$provider == 7202 ~ 'St. Joseph',
  df$provider == 7203 ~ 'Memorial',
  df$provider == 7204 ~ 'Miriam',
  df$provider == 7205 ~ 'Rhode Island Hospital',
  df$provider == 7206 ~ 'Roger Williams',
  df$provider == 7209 ~ 'South County',
  df$provider == 7210 ~ 'Kent County',
  df$provider == 7211 ~ 'Westerly',
  df$provider == 7212 ~ 'Rehab of RI',
  df$provider == 7213 ~ 'Landmark Medical Center',
  df$provider == 7214 ~ 'Women and Infants',
  df$provider == 7215 ~ 'Bradley',
  TRUE ~ 'Butler'
)


df$campus <- case_when(

7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

In this section, I trained and tuned two models to predict two different target variables. This process included taking out empty rows, changing varibale types, and splitting the data into training and testing. After training a decision tree and using cross validation to train and test different models, I compared the results. I found it interesting that my rpart1SE model had better accuracy for the prediction of length of stay while glmnet had better accuracy for the prediction of total cost.
